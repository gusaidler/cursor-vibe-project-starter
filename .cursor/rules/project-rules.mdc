## General Guidelines
- Write Python code adhering to PEP 8 for readability and consistency.
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Include docstrings for all functions and classes.
- Handle exceptions with clear error messages or logging.

## Best Practices for Python CLI Development
- Use Click to define commands and options with clear help text.
- Validate inputs with Pydantic to catch errors early.
- Keep the CLI intuitive with concise prompts and examples.
- Minimize OpenRouter API calls to optimize performance and cost.

## Documentation Instructions
- After completing a feature or fix, append an entry to `docs/development-log.md` with:
  - Incremental sequence, starting from 1
  - Summary of changes
  - Reasoning behind decisions
- Before starting a session, review `docs/development-log.md` for context.

## Example Rules
- "Add type hints to all function signatures for clarity."
- "Provide usage examples in Click command help text."
- "Log API requests and responses (excluding sensitive data) for debugging."
